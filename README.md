# Kalman Filter for IMU-Based Orientation Estimation  

This project implements a Kalman Filter for estimating orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) using data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).  
The Kalman Filter fuses noisy accelerometer and gyroscope data to provide stable, drift-corrected, real-time orientation estimates, which can be used in robotics, drones, or satellite attitude control.

## Features  
- Sensor fusion: combines accelerometer & gyroscope readings  
- Noise reduction: filters out random fluctuations in raw IMU signals  
- Drift correction: compensates for gyroscope bias  
- Lightweight & modular: easy integration with embedded systems
